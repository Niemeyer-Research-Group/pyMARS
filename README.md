Python-based (chemical kinetic) Model Automatic Reduction Software (MARS), which consists of multiple techniques for reducing the size and complexity of detailed chemical kinetic models.

pyMARS currently consists of two stages:

 1. Directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA)
 2. Unimportant reaction elimination

Additional reduction stages, including isomer lumping and CSP-based quasi-steady-state (QSS) species reduction, are currently under development and testing.
