 NORMAL INPUT:

    REDUCED_MODEL :: model reduced by the previous reduction
                     cantera solutions object
                     this can be tested with the cti from the example_files folder. either with gri30 (which has
                        53 species) or with artificial mech which has 4 species. 

    EP_STAR       :: epsilon star value
                     float between 0 and 1
                      
    DRGEP_COEFFS  :: dictionary containing strings for species names with accompanying floats between 0 and 1
                     these floats will be checked against the epsilon star value
                     the strings need to be species within the model (cantera solutions object)
                     
    SAFE          :: array of species names (strings) 
                     species in the safe array should not be removed from the reduced model (put in limbo)


GRI30.CTI CONTAINS:

    H2  H   O   O2   OH   H2O   C   CH
    and 45 others...


LIMBO DEFINTION:
    limbo is a list of species that could potentially be removed
    to be in limbo, two primary conditions must be met:
        1. value specified in the drgep dictionary is less than the epsilon star value
        2. the element in not in the "safe" array
